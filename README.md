# Arduino Library for 7-Segment Display using 4094 shift register

This is a library to control 7-segment display using 4094 8-bit shift register.

# Features!
  - Supports upto 255 digits.
  - Support for both common anode and common cathode displays
  - Directly print multiple integer values
  - Print MSB or LSB (depending on user's choice) in case of number exceeding display.
  - Print numbers using arrays
  - Add/remove leading zeros
  - Blink at specific location on display    


# Hardware

The following are a must:
  - Any arduino board
  - Shift register 4094
  - 7-segment led display.

Any number and size of display can be added. Hardware requirements may change due to larger current requirement of bigger sized displays.
